# leetcode premium problem
# You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

# -1 - A wall or an obstacle.
# 0 - A gate.
# INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
# Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a Gate, that room should remain filled with INF
